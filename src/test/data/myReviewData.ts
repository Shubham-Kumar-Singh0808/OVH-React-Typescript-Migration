However, to ensure that your&#10;        performance&#10;        is continuously tracked, recognized and recorded there will be a comprehensive performance&#10;        management system. â€“ Performance Planning and Progress Record</p>&#10;&#10;<p>You will receive periodic&#10;        performance&#10;        reviews. The review will be conducted by your supervisor, who will discuss it with you. Your first&#10;        performance evaluation will be after completion of your one month period. If an employee avails leave&#10;        (s) during probation period, the probation period / service agreement (applicable) will be extended to the&#10;        number&#10;        of working days an employee has availed. After that review, performance evaluations will be conducted&#10;        monthly, or more frequently as deemed fit by the Company. The frequency of performance evaluations&#10;        may vary depending upon length of service, job position, past performance, changes in job duties or&#10;        recurring performance problems.</p>&#10;&#10;<p>Your performance evaluations may review factors such&#10;        as the quality and quantity of the work you perform, your knowledge of the job, your initiative, your&#10;        work attitude and your attitude toward others. The performance evaluation should help you become&#10;        aware of your progress, areas for improvement and objectives or goals for future work performance.&#10;        Positive performance evaluations do not guarantee increases in salary or promotions.
